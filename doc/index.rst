Dexela camera plugin

Introduction
************
The Dexela detector is a brand product of  PerkinElmer. PerkinElmer has recently Acquired Dexela Limited a
manufacturer of CMOS flat panel. Nevertheless the Dexela detector SDK still remains not compatible with the other PerkinElmer
detector SDK (see perkinelemer plugin) and one need to use this camera plugin instead.

Prerequisite
************
The Dexela detector model sensor2923 has only been tested at ESRF.

The detector is controlled via an acquisition board: PIXCI(R) E4 PCIExpress Camera Link board (EPIX,Inc.).

You need to install the acquisition card sdk. It was tested with 3.8 version (xclib). You can find them at http://www.epixinc.com/support/files.php .

You also need to install libdexela which is not yet GPL. see detail with mihael.koep@softwareschneiderei.de.

BIOS configuration
==================

You should disable all power saving mode like CSTATE and disable also multiple-threading feature of cpu.

At ESRF, SuperMicro computers as to be configured like this:

 - Simultaneous Multi-threading as to be disabled
 - C1E support as to be disable
 - Intel CSTATE Tech as to be disable

Linux kernel configuration
==========================

As the PIXCI acquisition card needs a low jitters configuration, you need to change some kernel parameters.
To do so, you have to change in grub configuration file (under /etc/default/grub for debian) the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
by adding theses options:
 - pcie_aspm=off
 - intel_idle.max_cstate=0
 - processor.max_cstate=0
 - idle=poll
 - mce=ignore_ce 
 - ipmi_si.force_kipmi=0 
 - nmi_watchdog=0 
 - noht 
 - nosoftlockup 
 - isolcpus=0

the whole line will look something like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 quiet pcie_aspm=off intel_idle.max_cstate=0 processor.max_cstate=0 idle=poll mce=ignore_ce ipmi_si.force_kipmi=0 nmi_watchdog=0 noht nosoftlockup isolcpus=0"

You also have to uninstall or disable the irqbalance process.
On Debian you can simply type:

.. code-block:: sh

  sudo apt-get purge irqbalance

Initialization and Capabilities
*******************************
In order to help people to understand how the camera plugin has been implemented in LImA this section
provide some important information about the developer's choices.

Camera initialization
**********************

The camera will be initialized   within the **DexelaInterface**  object.
The parameter to pass to DexelaInterface constructor is the fill path need for the acquisition card.
This file is generated by xcap software provided by PIXCI. you can find some example in the config directory.

Std capabilities
................

This plugin has been implemented in respect of the mandatory capabilites but with limitations according 
due to the detector specific features and with some programmer's  choices.  We do not explain here the standard Lima capabilites
but you can find in this section the useful information on the Dexela specfic features.

* HwDetInfo
 The Dexela detector as a pixel size of 74.8e-6 m (74.8 um) and the image data type is fixed to 16bpp (bit per pixel).
  

* HwSync
 The supported trigger modes are IntTrig, IntTrigMult, ExtTrigMult and ExtGate.

 The exposure time range is 0.0116 (1/86) to 120 seconds.

 The latency time is not manage.


Optional capabilities
........................
In addition to the standard capabilities, we make the choice to implement some optional capabilities in order to 
have an improved simulation.

* HwShutter
 There is no shutter capability. 

* HwRoi
 There is no hardware capability, but Lima provides the sofware Roi as well.

* HwBin 
 The supported hardware binning factors are 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4.


How to use
````````````
The LimaCCDs tango server provides a complete interface to the dexela plugin so feel free to test.

For a quick test one can use python, is this a short code example:

.. code-block:: python

  from Lima import Dexela
  from lima impor Core
  import time

  hwint = Dexela.Interface('./sensor2923.fmt')
  ct = Core.CtControl(hwint)

  acq = ct.acquisition()

  # setting new file parameters and autosaving mode
  saving=ct.saving()

  pars=saving.getParameters()
  pars.directory='/tmp/'
  pars.prefix='testdexela_'
  pars.suffix='.edf'
  pars.fileFormat=Core.CtSaving.EDF
  pars.savingMode=Core.CtSaving.AutoFrame
  saving.setParameters(pars)


  # now ask for 2 sec. exposure and 10 frames
  acq.setAcqExpoTime(2)
  acq.setNbImages(10) 
  
  ct.prepareAcq()
  ct.startAcq()

  # wait for last image (#9) ready
  lastimg = ct.getStatus().ImageCounters.LastImageReady
  while lastimg !=9:
    time.sleep(1)
    lastimg = ct.getStatus().ImageCounters.LastImageReady
 
  # read a image
  im0 = ct.ReadImage(0)
